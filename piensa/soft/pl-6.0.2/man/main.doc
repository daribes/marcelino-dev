\begin{abstract}
SWI-Prolog started life in 1986 as a Prolog in the Edinburgh tradition.
Its development has been guided from the very beginning by the desire to
build large scale applications in Prolog.  For this reason it stresses
connectivity to the C-language, few system limits, comprehensive
memory management, modules, multi-threading, coroutining, constraints
and a fast and interactive development environment. Portable libraries
for graphics, databases, networking, web services, XML, RDF and many
more complete the system.

SWI-Prolog is compliant to part one of ISO standard Prolog. In addition
it provides functionality compatible with Quintus, SICStus, LPA, Ciao and
many more.

Since version 5 the system and all bundled extensions are distributed
under the Lesser General Public License (LGPL) and the system enjoys
attention from a large community of academic researchers, students
and commercial users.

This document gives an overview of the features, system limits and
built-in predicates.

\begin{quote}
SWI-Prolog is a Prolog implementation based on a subset of the WAM
(Warren Abstract Machine). SWI-Prolog was developed as an {\em open}
Prolog environment, providing a powerful and bi-directional interface to
C in an era when this was unknown to other Prolog implementations. This
environment is required to deal with XPCE, an object-oriented GUI system
developed at SWI. XPCE is used at SWI for the development of
knowledge-intensive graphical applications.

As SWI-Prolog became more popular, a large user community provided
requirements that guided its development. Compatibility, portability,
scalability, stability and providing a powerful development environment
have been the most important requirements. Edinburgh, Quintus, SICStus
and the ISO-standard guide the development of the SWI-Prolog primitives.

This document gives an overview of the features, system limits and
built-in predicates.
