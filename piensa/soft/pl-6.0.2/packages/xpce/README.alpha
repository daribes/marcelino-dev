Issues for the DEC alpha port running OSF/1 3.2

* Requires #define O_INLINE 1: check for predefined inline keyword to
  set this

* CFLAGS: -std

* Making a shared library: LDFLAGS=-shared library

* alloca() returns char *!?  Maybe we should use another name and use
  a #define to fix this problem, or cast in all places it is used.

* #undef stdin isn't appreciated.  Test in configure

* date now uses time_t, malloc size_t.  See what problems that poses
  on other systems.
