This directory contains scripts to create  the installer for MS-Windows.
This installer is created  by  the   Free  Software  install system NSIS
(http://nsis.sourceforge.net). We currently use version 2.0b3.

Normally the installer is  created  from   the  Makefile.mak  in the src
directory:

	nmake /f Makefile.mak installer
