The DCG compiler. The original code was copied from C-Prolog and written
by Fernando Pereira, EDCAAD, Edinburgh,  1984.   Since  then many people
have modified and extended this code. It's a nice mess now and it should
be redone from scratch. I won't be doing   this  before I get a complete
spec explaining all an implementor needs to   know  about DCG. I'm a too
basic user of this facility myself (though   I  learned some tricks from
people reporting bugs :-)

The original version contained '$t_tidy'/2  to   convert  ((a,b),  c) to
(a,(b,c)), but as the  SWI-Prolog  compiler   doesn't  really  care (the
resulting code is simply the same), I've removed that.

On the DCG Translation of {}

	a --> x, {y}.

There are two options.  In traditional systems we see:

	a(A, B) :- x(A, B), y.

And in modern system we see:

	a(A, B) :- x(A, C), y, B=C.


Martin Sondergaard's grammar was breaking down on
=================================================

s --> v, star0, {write('You can not do that')}.
star0 --> [].
star0 --> [_], star0.

meaning to write a  message  for  any   sentence  starting  with  a `v',
skipping the remainder. With delayed binding  this causes a large number
of messages as star0 only eats one token on backtracing.

You can fix this using remaining as below rather then star0.

remaining --> [_], !, remaining.
remaining --> [].


Without delayed unification of the tail we get the following trouble
====================================================================
(comment from Richard O'Keefe)

Suppose I have

    p --> [a], !, {fail}. p --> [].

That is, p//0 is suppose to match the empty  string as long as it is not
followed by a. Now consider

    p([a], [a])

If the first clause is translated as

    p(S0, S) :- S0 = [a|S1], !, fail, S = S1.

then it will work *correctly*, and the call  p([a], [a]) will fail as it
is supposed to. If the first clause is translated as

    p(S0, S) :- S0 = [a|S], !, fail.

then the call p([a], [a]) will succeed, which is quite definitely wrong.
